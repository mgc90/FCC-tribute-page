          <li>"Truth never penetrates an unwilling mind."</li>
          <li>"Don't talk unless you can improve the silence."</li>
          <li>"Creativity is suspended between memory and forgetting."</li>
          <li>"To fall in love is to create a religion that has a fallible god."</li>
          <li>"While we are asleep in this world, we are awake in another one"</li>
          <li>"I have committed the worst of sins one can commit... I have not been happy."</li>
          <li>"Nothing is built on stone; all is built on sand, but we must build as if the sand were stone."</li>
          <li>"So plant your own gardens and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers."</li>
          <li>"All that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art."</li>
